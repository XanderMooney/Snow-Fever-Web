# Snow-Fever-Web
Example website assignment using HTML/JS/CSS. Is very silly but shows responsive design techniques and uses bootstrap in some scenarios.

This webpage was made in collaboration with [Jack Kennedy](https://github.com/ponyfan88)

He did the following:
- Navbar, with inspiration from [this codepen](https://codepen.io/erikterwan/pen/EVzeRP)
- Modified snowing effect from [pure-snow.js](https://github.com/hyperstown/pure-snow.js)
- Footer
- Other JS effects
